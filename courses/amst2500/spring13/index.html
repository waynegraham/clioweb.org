            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>This course is designed as a intensive exploration of the adaptation of
        American Studies to a digital environment. As such it is a course in
        applied American Studies, and will examine not only what American
        Studies is, but also what presence and use of digital media and tools
        does to the practice of American Studies. The course is reading,
        discussing, and making intensive.</p>

            <p>By the end of this course, students should:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>understand the ways that digital media and tools impact American Studies, and vice versa</li>
                <li>have a working knowledge of basic web design and development,
            including markup (HTML), styling (Cascading Style Sheets), and behavior
            (JavaScript)</li>
                <li>have a working knowledge of basic 3D modelling and desktop
            fabrication, and demonstrate understanding of how objects—original and fabricated—can affect
            research and pedagogy in American Studies.</li>

    <h1>Requirements</h1>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Online Exhibition (Due March 20)</h3>

    <p>For this project, choose a topic relevant to American Studies to
research and create a simple online exhibition. You can put this
exhibition on your UVa web server, or serve the site from your Github
account using their Pages feature.</p>
<p>The site should have original content, be well-organized, and have an origina design that shapes the user experience of your content. It should 

<h3>3D Model and Print (May 1)</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to explore the scholarly and pedagogical
possibilities of 3D modeling and printing in American Studies. You
should find an object you'd like to scan and print, and write a 1-page
summary of the kinds of topics and questions you could explore in
scanning and printing your object.</p>

<h2>Readings and Participation</h2>

<p>The readings listed for each session should be completed before class.
However, keep in mind that the readings presented are often only a
snapshot of a much larger conversation. Most of the readings are
digital, not only in format, but in concept. Especially on the Web, the
ease with with publications can build on each other often makes it
important to trace conversations back as far as possible. You should make sure you do that whenever possible, and bring those findings into the conversation in class.</p>

  <h2>Computers and Internet</h2>

  <p>Since this course uses computers and the Internet extensively, familiarity with both is essential. If you do not have internet service, please obtain it at the earliest available moment and become comfortable with the software and protocols. We will use free and/or open source software as much as possible in this course.</p>

  <p>As any experienced web developer can attest, you will need several
browsers to test your web work. For Macintosh, you’ll need the latest
versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari. For Windows, you will
need to test on Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>A good text editor is also a must. Adobe Dreamweaver is a good option, but there are many text editor applications. Mac folks, for instance, can use Textmate, BBEdit, or Coda, among others. Sublime Text 2 is a good option for Windows and Mac platforms. But remember: this class does not focus on a particular piece of software for web development; It focuses on how to write clean, semantic code. I can try my best to help troubleshoot software questions in and out of class, but you should rely primarily on the software’s documentation and company for support.</p>

<p>You'll need a free account on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> to use as a code repository and tracking system.</p>

<section id="work-and-grades">
<h1>Work and Grades</h1>

<p>Work for the course will be weighted as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Web Portfolio (10%)</li>
    <li>Web Site Exhibit (25%)</li>
    <li>3D Model & Print (25%)</li>
    <li>Class Participation (40%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Working in Groups: Digital work is very often collaborative in nature, so I encourage you to work together in groups on a project. For grading purposes, if you do decide to work as a group, I will require a brief written description of how the team worked together and how each person contributed to solving problems presented by a particular assignment. So, you’re free to turn in a particular assignment as a group, but I need to know that 1) everyone in the group participated in the assignment, and 2) there was transfer of knowledge among the group, meaning that everyone in the group learned from each other. In most digital humanities projects outside this class, team members will specialize in a particular area, and its safe to assume that once this class is over you will choose a particular area or two as a specialty. But for this class, I expect you to learn about and contribute to all the areas involved in the creation of a digital project.</p>

<p>In a class where collaboration and peer feedback are frequent,
punctuality is absolutely necessary. Assignments not ready for
presentation cannot benefit from class feedback. Therefore,
assignments are due on the date indicated on the syllabus. Late
assignments will be accepted up to a week after the due date; One letter
grade, however, be deducted for each day late. After the grace period, late submissions will receive an “F” except in cases of documented and university sanctioned reasons.</p>

<p>A Word of Warning: I will not accept technology-related excuses for late or incomplete assignments. Computers, like many other things built by human beings, are imperfect. A computer or other technology-related problem can (and probably will) occur, so you should take steps to minimize these problems. Back up your work obsessively. Complete your assignments as early as possible. If your computer shorts out, your hard drive crashes, or the Internet goes down, make sure you have access to other computer resources. There are several computer labs for students on campus, which are free to use.</p>

<p>Grades for the course are assigned in the following manner:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A – Outstanding work, complete mastery of the material presented, combined with some originality.</li>
    <li>B – A solid command of the material with some minor gaps or mistakes.</li>
    <li>C – Some knowledge of the material; Infrequent but significant confusions and errors present.</li>
    <li>D – An incomplete, minimal knowldge of the material; Frequent and/or major confusions and errors.</li>
    <li>F – A complete lack of understanding of the course material.</li>
    <li>I – There are no incompletes given in this course except in cases of bona fide and documented instances in accordance with the regulations of the university.</li>
    <li>P – For a “pass” a “C” average is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you receive a grade with which you do not agree, feel free to discuss it with me by appointment. I am open to changing a grade if given sufficient reason, but be very prepared to make your case.</p>
