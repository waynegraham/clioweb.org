    <h1>Hobbits in Kentucky</h1>

  </header>

  <div class="content">

    <p>John Holbo's post <a href="http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/sung_to_the_tune_of_my_old_kentucky_home/">Sung to the tune of "My Old Kentucky Home"</a> discusses an essay by Guy Davenport on Tolkien and Kentucky:</p>

<blockquote><p>The closest I have ever gotten to the secret and inner Tolkien was in a casual conversation on a snowy day in Shelbyville, Kentucky. I forget how in the world we came to talk about Tolkien at all, but I began plying questions as soon as I knew that I was talking to a man who had been at Oxford as a classmate of Ronald TolkienÇƒÙs. He was a history teacher, Allen Barnett. He had never read The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings. Indeed, he was astonished and pleased to know that his friend of so many years ago had made a name for himself as a writer.</p>

<p>"Imagine that! You know, he used to have the most extraordinary interest in the people here in Kentucky. He could never get enough of my tales of Kentucky folk. He used to make me repeat family names like Barefoot and Boffin and Baggins and good country names like that."</p>

<p>And out the window I could see tobacco barns. The charming anachronism of the hobbitsÇƒÙ pipes suddenly made sense in a new way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ralph Luker also <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/13541.html">quotes another passage</a> from Davenport's essay:</p>

<blockquote><p>Practically all the names of Tolkien's hobbits are listed in my Lexington phone book, and those that aren't can be found over in Shelbyville. Like as not, they grow and cure pipe-weed for a living. Talk with them, and their turns of phrase are pure hobbit: 'I hear tell,' 'right agin,' 'so Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way,' 'this very month as is.' These are English locutions, of course, but ones that are heard oftener now in Kentucky than in England.</p>

<p>I despaired of trying to tell Barnett what his talk of Kentucky folk became in Tolkien's imagination. I urged him to read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> but as our paths have never crossed again, I don't know that he did. Nor if he knew that he created by an Oxford fire and in walks along the Cherwell and Isis the Bagginses, Boffins, Tooks, Brandybucks, Grubbs, Burrowses, Goodbodies, and Proudfoots (or Proudfeet, as a branch of the family will have it) who were, we are told, the special study of Gandalf the Grey, the only wizard who was interested in their bashful and countrified ways.</p></blockquote>

<p>In <a href="http://www.shadowcouncil.org/wilson/archives/004921.html">Hobbits in Kentucky</a> the Elfin Ethicist suggests looking at early 2oth-century census records. The Ethicist also looks at last names in <a href="http://whitepages.com">WhitePages.com</a> with few results to corroborate Davenport's story. Amusingly, he found that Sam W. Gamgee lives in New Jersey and Meriadoc Brandybuck lives in Key West. I found that B. Baggins lives in Buckingham, Virginia.</p>

<p>I knew a guy at <a href="http://www.morehead.edu">Morehead State University</a> (in Morehead, Kentucky) whose last name was Boffins and a girl whose last name was Grubb. I seem to recall some Bagginses who live in Wise County, Virginia, right on the Kentucky border, but I could be wrong about this (none show up on WhitePages.com). Though these locations are a little farther east than central Kentucky (Morehead is actually an hour and a half east of Lexington), its still quite possible. I remember about 15 years ago an older man back home said "eleventy-first" instead of "one-hundred eleven" and I thought he was quite odd. I'm not sure if he had read <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (I hadn't at the time). He probably had and was joking around, but you never know. I would be interested in the speech and dialect connections, but this might be a little harder to research.</p>
