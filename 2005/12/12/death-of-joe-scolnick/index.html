    <h1>Death of Joe Scolnick</h1>

  </header>

  <div class="content">

    <p>I transferred to <a href="http://www.uvawise.edu">UVa-Wise</a> in August, 1998, and at the mini-orientation for transfer students advisors were assigned. Being a political science major, I drew Joe Scolnick, a tall, quirky political science professor who looked the part of a college professor perfectly. He wore tweed jackets every day, even in the summer, and drove a small, rusty car. He entered the classroom booming "Hello, Hello, Hello" before striking a huge grin that made his eyes crinkle and caused his head to tilt slightly. I found him a little odd at first, but it didn't take too long before I felt lucky to be Dr. Scolnick's advisee. Few students are fortunate enough to have an advisor with such a positive outlook on life and who are willing to get to know students and contribute to the university community as much as Dr. Scolnick. Lively lectures were at times augmented by what he called "digressions" about his days as a tennis player at UVa or as an office in the U.S. Navy.</p>

<p><img src="/i/scolnick.jpg" alt="Dr. Joseph M. Scolnick, Jr." /></p>

<p>Dr. Scolnick regularly taught four classes a semester. I took five total from him during my time at UVa-Wise, partly because there were only three professors in the Political Science department, but mostly because his classes were so great. My favorite was Pols 306: The American Presidency, taken as the impeachment of President Bill Clinton was underway. Lively discussion about history, the Constitution, politics, and news media complemented lectures about past presidencies and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Neustadt">Richard Neustadt's thoughts about presidential power</a>. Students were engaged with Dr. Scolnick, and Scolnick made it worth our while. There were some times that we actually stayed later after class (no, really!) to listen to lectures or engage Dr. Scolnick in some debate.</p>

<p>Dr. Scolnick passed away last Wednesday evening, sitting in his reading chair with a book in hand. His gifts to his university can't be measured by grades or the number of graduates who he mentored. His contribution to that small liberal arts college is immeasurable, and I am grateful to have known him. Thank you, Dr. Scolnick, for your advice to me personally and for your service and support to your university.</p>

<p>Here's a story from the <a href="http://www.timesnews.net/archives/index3.php?id=9468332">Kingsport Times-News on Dr. Scolnick</a> (registration free, but required).</p>

<blockquote><h3>Beloved UVa-Wise professor passes away at home</h3>

<p>Author: STEPHEN IGO</p>

<p>WISE - One of the most beloved, distinctive voices to grace the campus of the University of Virginia's College at Wise has been silenced. But oh, what an echo remains.</p>

<p>When political science professor Joe Scolnick failed to show for his 10 a.m. class on Wednesday, concerned college officials dispatched campus police to his residence in Wise, located in an area behind the county courthouse. Town of Wise police were called to the residence, where his body was found seated in a chair. Scolnick apparently passed away Tuesday evening while reading a book.</p>

<p>The 65-year-old Scolnick was a campus icon at UVa-Wise. If students, faculty and staff weren't aware of his presence by sight, they could surely hear him coming. Since 1973 Scolnick's deep, booming voice was as familiar a fixture on campus as is the placid lake. The one undoubtedly provided a cosmic balance to the other.</p>

<p>"We will miss his inimitable voice and his fervent dedication to his students and the college," stated a college press release issued Wednesday.</p>

<p>"He loved fine art, SpongeBob cartoons, comic books and was just a real interesting character," said UVa-Wise Director of College Relations Jane Meade-Dean. "I just can't imagine the campus without him. He had a big, booming voice. You could hear him coming from a good distance away. That was just one of the things that endeared him to you."</p>

<p>Herself a UVa-Wise graduate, Meade-Dean took a couple of Scolnick's classes and recalls not only being academically challenged, but well-entertained.</p>

<p>"So many people who attended this college had at least one class with Joe Scolnick," she said. "He was just really well-loved."</p>

<p>When UVa-Wise Provost Gil Blackburn assumed his post two years ago, he didn't expect to find a fellow swabbie waiting to welcome him aboard the region's flagship of higher education.</p>

<p>"When I first came here we had a conversation and found out we were each in the Navy. And when we got to talking about where we were and on what ship and when and all that, we found out we were on the same ship, the flagship of the Atlantic fleet's amphibious force, the USS Taconic," Blackburn said.</p>

<p>Their service on the vessel overlapped by only about a month in 1963, plus Scolnick was a lieutenant junior grade communications officer on the staff of Vice Admiral Jack McCain, father of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., while Blackburn came aboard the Taconic as a third class petty officer (enlisted sailor) on the admiral's Tactical Air Group II staff.</p>

<p>Back then Scolnick and Blackburn were the proverbial ships passing in the night, on the same ship no less. Blackburn is still a bit floored about the odds of meeting a Taconic shipmate four-plus decades later on a little college campus far removed by years and about as far from the sea as one can get and still be in Virginia.</p>

<p>"We had a good rapport," Blackburn said. "Prior to that I didn't know anybody who had ever heard of the ship, let alone serve on it. I had two (USS Taconic caps) with the hull number and ship name on them, and I gave him one of the caps, and he really liked that."</p>

<p>Born in New York, Scolnick completed his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Virginia and doctorate in political science at the University of Kentucky. He was a visiting professor at the Air War College in 1988-89, and a regular participant in the International Studies Association and other groups related to American foreign policy, international relations and national security.</p>

<p>State Delegate Terry Kilgore, R-Gate City, said he was on the other side of the political fence from Scolnick, but Scolnick didn't flunk him for it when Kilgore was an undergrad at the college.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, I thought a lot of Professor Scolnick, even though I didn't agree with him politically. He was great. He helped mold a lot of lives over the years," Kilgore said. "He was just a great guy. He was my adviser and took time out of his schedule to talk to me about law school and what classes to take. He was just a real good guy. He went out of his way to help students. Professor Scolnick liked to talk, and he could really talk. His heart was there (at UVa-Wise). I'm sure he could have gone to all kinds of different places to teach, but his heart belonged to UVa-Wise."</p>

<p>"It was a shock for all of us. I could mention some things, and anecdotes come to mind, but Professor Scolnick made the college his family and had been here for many years, so he developed a strong personal relationship with his students. He was a father figure. Because he had no children of his own, he considered his students his family," said Blackburn.</p>

<p>"He had a deep, commanding voice that was also compassionate. He was a crusty old gentleman in one sense, but he also had a heart of gold and everybody knew he was very sentimental about things important to him. And this institution and his students were right up there at the top of those."</p>

<p>Meade-Dean said Scolnick was teaching a pair of Political Science 101 classes this semester, another on international relations, and a fourth on legislative behavior and processes. She said Garrett Sheldon, chair of the college's social and behavioral sciences department, will meet with those students on Thursday and Friday to settle how to handle semester final exams next week.</p>

<p>And if, perchance, Scolnick's students hear a voice providing the answers next week, it won't likely come as a whisper. For it has been known to thunder in December.</p></blockquote>
