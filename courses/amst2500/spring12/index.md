## Introduction

This course is designed as a intensive exploration of the adaptation of history to a digital environment. As such it is a course in applied history. While the central goal of the course is the development of an original digital history project of professional quality, the course will also examine issues in project management, information design, code (HTML, CSS, PHP) and aesthetic design.

## Requirements

### Reading

The texts in this class provide you with the background in several areas that might be unfamiliar to historians, and furnish you with a modest web design and development library for future work. A typical class will involve around an hour of discussing the readings for that particular week, an hour of lecture/presentation about a particular design/development topic, and an hour of practical exploration. Times and occurrences of these three will vary, but the structure will almost always be the same. The readings assigned for a particular class are often related to the applied portion of that class, so come prepared to not only discuss the reading material, but also to use the material in the class practicum.

The following books are required for this course. All are available in the campus bookstore except for Boulton and Chimero.

* Boulton, Mark. [A Practical Guide to Designing for the Web](http://fivesimplesteps.co.uk).
* Chimero, Frank. [The Shape of Design](http://shapeofdesign.com).
* Eismann, Katrin. Photoshop Restoration & Retouching. (3rd ed.)
* Garrett, Jesse James. The Elements of User Experience.
* McCloud, Scott. Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art.
* Meloni, Julie, Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours.
* Zeldman, Jeffrey. _Designing with Web Standards_. (3rd ed.)

In addition to assigned books and articles, I also ask that you pay attention to the “journals” of web design and development. Just as historians regularly read academic journals like the Journal of American History or The American Historical Review, professional web designers and developers also have publications that they regularly read and contribute to. You can download an OPML file on the course website to automatically add these RSS feeds to your newsreader.

* [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com)
* [Digital-Web Magazine](http://digital-web.com)
* [Vitamin](http://thinkvitamin.com)
* [Boxes and Arrows](http://boxesandarrows.com)

For inspiration, I recommend subscribing to a few design galleries and blogs:

* [CSS Beauty](cssbeauty.com)
* [CSS Mania](http://cssmania.com)
* [DesignSnips](designsnips.com)
* [Media Queries](http://mediaqueri.es)
* [PatternTap](http://patterntap.com)

### Writing
You are required to create and maintain a weblog through the course. Specifics about blog assignments are covered in the Work section. I recommend WordPress.com for hosted blogging, or downloading and installing WordPress on your own server (which we’ll do this semester) but other options are available. Please add the URL to your blog to your user profile on the course site by February 2.

### Software, Hardware, Hosting

Since this course uses computers and the Internet extensively, familiarity with both is essential. If you do not have internet service, please obtain it at the earliest available moment and become comfortable with the software and protocols. Although the university does not require the purchase of a computer, you to consider the investment if you do not have one.

As any experienced web developer can attest, you will need several browsers to test your web work. For Macintosh, you’ll need Firefox 3, Safari 3, and Opera 9. For Windows, you will need to test on Firefox 3, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 6. While IE 7 is rapidly replacing IE 6 on Windows machines, IE 6 still has a significant market share, so testing on it is required.

You will need access to an image editing program. For those who will continue with new media as part of their history graduate work, Adobe Photoshop is the de facto standard, and is the software we’ll use in class. For those who see their new media work as occasional, Adobe Photoshop Elements is a powerful (and inexpensive) program that, except for some advanced color capabilities, has the same features as Photoshop CS3.

A good text editor is also a must. Adobe Dreamweaver is a good option (and is the one installed in the lab), but there are many text editor applications. Remember: this class does not focus on a particular piece of software for web development; It focuses on how to write clean, semantic code. I can try my best to help troubleshoot software questions in and out of class, but you should rely primarily on the software’s documentation and company for support.

This class also requires access to web hosting that has, at minimum, PHP5 and MySQL5. Good web hosting is incredibly cheap: Dreamhost <dreamhost.com>, for instance, provides a variety of plans that, after paying upfront for a year, end up costing $10/month. If you decide to go this route, consider teaming up with classmates to share an account and divide costs. Alternatively, I can provide free access to the Omeka dev server. This would include your own folder, username, and MySQL database. With this option, however, you work will be wiped at the end of the semester. (I can provide a zip of your folder’s contents and database.) I highly recommend getting your own server space to host your own website and develop any digital history work beyond this course.

An FTP program is also necessary to transfer files from your computer to your server. GMU ITU Support Center provides a free download of Secure Shell for Windows. Free options for Macintosh include CyberDuck and Fugu. I prefer an inexpensive Mac program called Transmit.

## Work

Work for the course will be weighted as follows:

* Strategy and Scope (10%)
* Install and Modify a CMS (10%)
* Sitemap and Wireframes (10%)
* Design Rationale (10%)
* XHTML/CSS Mockups (10%)
* Final Project (25%)
* Blog—including posts and comments (25%)

Strategy and Scope (Due 02/16)
Create a 1-2 page document that details the overall goals of your final project, and includes a brief work plan for the rest of the semester, using subsequent assignments as milestones. (Example Strategy and Scope.) Feel free to use parts 2–4 of the NEH Digital Humanities Start- Up Grant Guidelines as a starting point. The document should address the following:
• Who is involved in the project? • What is the project? • Why is it useful or valuable? How does it contribute to historical inquiry and understanding? • What are the specific technological requirements and scope for the project? • How long will it take me to complete each of those requirements?
Its in your interest to do well on this assignment; I’ll will base a significant portion of your final project grade on how well you followed your plan for strategy and scope.
Installing and Modifying a CMS (Due 03/02)
For this assignment, choose either Omeka or WordPress, install it, modify a public theme, and install a plugin. You’re free to use either of these platforms for your final project; in fact, I encourage it. When modifying a public theme, you should at least do the following:
• Change CSS fonts, colors, layouts. • Edit header and footer information • Customize your installation’s homepage.
6
• Create a list of a particular set of blog posts in WordPress (by category) or items in Omeka (by item type or tag).
• Display specific item metadata on an items/show page in Omeka • Install a plugin and add and necessary plugin code to your public theme.
Write a blog post that links to your installation, discusses your modifcations, and reflects on your experience learning and modifying a CMS.
Sitemap and Wireframes (Due 03/23)
Create a site map for content on your site and wireframes using a drawing or outlining program. The site map should reflect the overall information organization of your final project, using techniques discussed in class. Wireframes should reflect content hierarchy and importance on specific pages, and should include at least 2-3 levels of site pages (homepage, browse page, show page, for example). Upload the site map and wireframes as a PDF document to your server, and link to it in a blog post that discusses your process for completing the assignment.
Design Rationale (Due 04/06)
For this assignment, create a 3-4 page document detailing the design rationale for your final project. it should include 1) A paragraph a logo/logotype for your project that explains the fonts used and design message, a color palette with hex values, and 2-3 color mockups of pages on your site. Upload the Design Rationale document as a PDF to your server, and link to it in a blog post that introduces the document and details your process for completing it.
XHTML/CSS Mockups (Due 04/20)
This assignment takes the color mockups presented in the Design Rationale as a basis for static HTML pages styled with CSS. Taking basic HTML and CSS techniques learned throughout the course, translate the color mockups into working HTML/CSS pages. The HTML and CSS must validate, and render well in browsers for both Mac and Windows. Upload these pages to your server, and link to them in a blog post that introduces the mockups and outlines your process for completing them. If you had to deviate from your color mockups, provide the reasons for doing so in your post.
Final Project (Presentations on 05/04; Final due 05/11)
All of the prior assignments contribute to the final project: the creation of a modest, reasonably sophisticated history web site. First, the content should be solid and engaging. Second, the site should be clear in its purpose and potential audience, and adhere to the Scope and Strategy, and information architecture set out at the beginning of the semester. Third, the site should demonstrate standards-based, accessible design. In other words, the site should have passed validation tests for XHTML and CSS. Fourth, the site’s design should also reflect knowledge of typography, layout, color, and graphic design, as reflected in the Design
7
Rationale and HTML/CSS mockups. Finally, there should be some effort make toward interactivity or online community building.

Weblog
Weekly blogs posts, at a minimum, are required for the course. In addition to reflecting on readings and assignments for class, consider your blog as a place to share new ideas, new resources you’ve found, or new design and development techniques you’ve tried. Use it also as a way to report progress on your projects. The blog is as much classroom participation as the discussions we have in class, so treat it accordingly. Regularly commenting or linking to other student posts are also required participation, so be sure to subscribe to your fellow students' blogs. As in Clio Wired 1, blog posts will be displayed on the course site, both on your individual student pages and on a “Classroom Stream of Consciousness” page.

Working in Groups: Digital humanities work is very often collaborative in nature, so I encourage you to work together in groups on a project. For grading purposes, if you do decide to work as a group, I will require a brief written description of how the team worked together and how each person contributed to solving problems presented by a particular assignment. So, you’re free to turn in a particular assignment as a group, but I need to know that 1) everyone in the group participated in the assignment, and 2) there was transfer of knowledge among the group, meaning that everyone in the group learned from each other. In most digital humanities projects outside this class, team members will specialize in a particular area, and its safe to assume that once this class is over you will choose a particular area or two as a specialty. But for this class, I expect you to learn about and contribute to all the areas involved in the creation of a digital history project.

## Policies

### Communicating

Feel free to contact me through any of these methods:

* AIM: jboggs22
* Google Talk: jeremy@clioweb.org
* Email: jboggs@gmu.edu (use “Hist 697: Your Subject” in your email subject line.)
* Phone: 703-244-1139 (cell)
* Twitter: clioweb

### Students with Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at (703) 993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.

Additionally, if during the semester you contract an illness, or are injured in some way that prevents you from completing assignments regularly and on-time, you will also need to contact the DRC.

### Late Assignments

In a class where collaboration and peer feedback are frequent, punctuality is absolutely necessary. Assignments not ready for presentation cannot benefit from class feedback; late blog posts result in fewer comments and less exchange among participants. Therefore, assignments are due on the date indicated on the syllabus; blog posts are due at noon the day before the due date in order to give class members a chance to comment. Late assignments and blog posts will be accepted up to a week after the due date; One letter grade, however, be deducted. After the grace period, late submissions will receive an “F” except in cases of documented and university sanctioned reasons.

A Word of Warning: I will not accept technology-related excuses for late or incomplete assignments. Computers, like many other things built by human beings, are imperfect. A computer or other technology-related problem can (and probably will) occur, so you should take steps to minimize these problems. Back up your work obsessively. Complete your assignments as early as possible. If your computer shorts out, your hard drive crashes, or the Internet goes down, make sure you have access to other computer resources. There are several computer labs for students on campus, which are free to use.

### Grades

Grades for the course are assigned in the following manner:

* A – Outstanding work, complete mastery of the material presented, combined with some originality.
* B – A solid command of the material with some minor gaps or mistakes.
* C – Some knowledge of the material; Infrequent but significant confusions and errors present.
* D – An incomplete, minimal knowldge of the material; Frequent and/or
major confusions and errors.
* F – A complete lack of understanding of the course material.
* I – There are no incompletes given in this course except in cases of bona fide and documented instances in accordance with the regulations of the university.
* P – For a “pass” a “C” average is required.

If you receive a grade with which you do not agree, feel free to discuss it with me by appointment. I am open to changing a grade if given sufficient reason, but be very prepared to make your case.
