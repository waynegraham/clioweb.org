    <h1>Memorial Day Weekend</h1>

  </header>

  <div class="content">

    <p>Jill and I visited our respective parents last weekend, both to celebrate Memorial Day and to celebrate my brother's 24th birthday, which was on May 28. We arrive in Big Stone Gap a little before midnight last friday, after a 7-hour drive from Fairfax. The drive wasn't too bad, considering it took over an hour to get from Fairfax to Manassas, which are only eight miles apart. I-66 on a friday evening is not fun. Needless to say, I was driving while Jill took a nap. I don't mind, since she taught a bunch of sixth-graders on a day before a holiday weekend.</p>

<p>Saturday evening I rode four-wheelers with my dad and a few of his friends from work. It was pretty awesome, even though I know little about four-wheelers and possess perhaps one-tenth of the courage that my riding companions had when going up or down really steep hills. Only one person flipped their four-wheeler. Here are some pictures from the ride. I didn't take too many because I was busy keeping up with everyone.</p>

<p>We started on a surface mine near my parents' house. I'm not sure if I've mentioned it before, but my dad works as a heavy equipment operator on a surface mine (called "strip jobs" at home, but I don't use that term because people I know in northern Virginia have never heard of it). I think he used to work at this mine, but has since moved farther south and west of this site.</p>

<p><img src="/i/4wheel_1.jpg" title="Image of a highwall on a surface mine." ></p>

<p>Here's a picture of a gradually reclaimed area of the surface mine. It was a fairly clear day with little humidity, so you can get a great view of the mountains miles away. I remember feeling a little disconcerted at first when I moved further east because the land gets more flat. I was so used to having huge hills and mountains all around me.</p>

<p><img src="/i/4wheel_2.jpg" title="Image of a gradually reclaimed surface mine" ></p>

<p>And another shot of the mountains. We're much further west now...we were actually in Kentucky when I took this shot. The Virginia-Kentucky line is about a mile from my parents' house, so we crossed over the line several times on our ride. I think we rode about 40 miles total on Saturday. The area in this shot is called Black Mountain. There are a number of trails and make-shift shelters in the area. We actually met another guy parked at a shelter who seemed rather high and inebriated. This is a shot looking west.</p>

<p>It was strange riding out in the middle of nowhere because I've grown so used to a busy environment over the past few years. Here there were no people, no cars, no noise (save for our four-wheelers, which were quite noisy), no lights. We stayed out riding until 2am (which was much longer than I anticipated, but fun nonetheless), and every now and then we'd stop and sit in the dark. I had forgotten how dense with stars the night sky is. You can't see many stars in Fairfax because of all the street lights and car headlights. On Black Mountain there are no lights at all, and the stars fill the sky like freckles.</p>

<p>On sunday I helped my aunt set up a presentation on a computer, picked up my wife and went back to my parents' house for a cook-out to celebrate.</p>

<p>Like me, Justin doesn't like to have his picture taken. Unfortunately for him (and fortunately for me), I had the camera. My favorite shots of Justin are the ones when he won't turn around. Like this one.</p>

<p><img src="/i/justinbd_1.jpg" title="Picture of my brother, Justin, who wouldn't turn to face me for a picture" ></p>

<p>We had plenty of bottled water for the event. My uncle Voyne (my grandmother's brother) is still amazed that they bottle water AND SELL IT and that PEOPLE ACTUALLY BUY IT. I remember he also laughed at the can of air I bought to clean my keyboard with. Canned air, can you imagine! I don't think he's ever bought a bottle of water, and I don't blame him. It is a rather funny concept. I buy it anyways, and obviously my parents buy it too.</p>

<p><img src="/i/water_1.jpg" title="Rows of bottled water, the symbol of America's convenience culture." ></p>

<p>Justin, Amber, Jill, and I played tennis later that evening. Not being very good tennis players, half of our shots went out of bounds or over the fence that enclosed the court. We had fun though, in a two-set match we tied 1-1. Amber wanted to play a third set to determine the winner, but the rest of us were satisfied with a tie. Everyone wins.</p>

<p>On monday Jill and I went to her parents house for yet more food. Donnie, my father-in-law, grilled some of the best steak I've had in a long time. And, of couse, my mother-in-law Sandy cooks everything really well. See for yourself:</p>

<p><img src="/i/pie_1.jpg" title="A glorious, tasty chocolate pie, courtesy of my mother-in-law Sandy. It tasted twice as good as it looked." ></p>

<p>I wish everyone could have one slice of this chocolate pie, because it was awesome. I had to take some home with me. Around 2pm Jill and I packed up and made our way back to Fairfax, getting home around 8:30pm. The only bad thing that happened is that I left my iPod at my parents house, and unless they mail it to me I won't have it until July 4 when we go back.</p>
