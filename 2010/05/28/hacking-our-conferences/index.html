    <h1>Hacking our Conferences</h1>

  </header>

  <div class="content">

    <p>Coming off another successful <a href="http://thatcamp.org"> THATCamp</a>, I keep thinking there is so much more we can do with the  unconference model in academia. The ideas generated from THATCamp, the  collegiality and openess lends itself to an intellectual playfulness and  exchange that is almost wholly lacking in traditional academic  conferences. It's time we start hacking our conferences.</p>

<p><strong>So,  let's do it already.
</strong></p>

<p>Where should we start?  Let's try this first: If you're going to an annual conference, try to  organize an unconference yourself, either with support of the  organization, or on your own off-site. Just do it. Tweet it. Blog it.  Find a spot that has some rooms, whiteboards, and wifi. Check the local  library or university and see if you can reserve some space. Or find a  bar or restaurant with wifi that can reserve some space. Add your  unconference to the <a href="http://barcamp.org">Barcamp</a> site, or <a href="http://wordpress.com">make your own site</a>, and post about the event on  Twitter. Unconferences don't have to be expensive; In fact, they should  be as cheap as possible. The  most important thing is providing space  for attendees to collaborate, discuss ideas, and turn those ideas into  future projects. (Wifi would be nice, too!) If you can do that, you're  most of the way there. If this isn't a conference hack, I don't know  what is.  Get the word out, see  if there are interested people, and give it a try! If you can get support from conference organizers, even better! It doesn't have to be associated with the conference itself (which may preclude you from using the conference venue as space),  but it can  involve folks attending the conference.</p>

<p>In fact, I'll  go so far as to say this: <strong>If it is within my power, I will make sure  to host or help with some kind of unconference event at every academic  conference I attend.</strong> I don't know how often I'll be successful, but  I'm going to try it. The worst that can happen, it seems to me, is that the  event doesn't occur. The best that can happen is that we get an  opportunity to share and discuss our work in ways ill-afforded by the  reading-a-paper-at-you format. We'll get to open our laptops, share our  notes, and scribble on a whiteboard/chalkboard/napkin and come up with  things to take with us and do after the conference.</p>

<p>We can also  begin proposing unconference-like sessions or workshops during  conferences themselves. This has already begun with much success; We  held a session at the 2010 American Historical Association annual  meeting on <a href="http://aha.confex.com/aha/2010/webprogram/Session3804.html">"Humanities in the Digital Age"</a>, which incorporated aspects  of the unconference format that was well-attended. Much broader in  scope, the <a href="http://digital-jumpstart.org">Digital Jumpstart</a> project has been widely attended at several  academic conferences, with more meetings in the works. With Digital  Jumpstart, the goal is to bring humanists together to give their digital  projects a boost, to hear about others' issues or solutions, and even  to find collaborators.</p>

<p>After some success with a few  unconference-like sessions, we could then begin petitioning  organizations to give even further support. The conference could devote  an entire day to an unconference, limit it to the first 100 people that  sign up, and have a coordinator to oversee the unconference. But it  should mainly be user-generated as much as possible. Like THATCamp,  conference attendees could propose session ideas ahead of time for the  unconference day. The organization could set up a voting system, similar  to Code4Lib and SXSW, where attendees voted for sessions to be included  in the program. The ones with the most votes would get on the  unconference program.</p>

<p>With the latter scenario, two of the most  common arguments against academic unconferences—lack of funding for such  events and lack of prestige or credit for the event—can be addressed.  You would be proposing to lead a session, and it would be accepted  through a potentially more competitive process that tradition academic  papers. The session's acceptance, number of votes, and eventual number  of attendees could certainly contribute to academic credit in some form.  And, since it would be an official part of the academic organization's  program, you should be able to receive travel funding for it as much as  if you were doing a workshop or reading a paper.</p>

<p>A third argument against academic unconferences usually involves some form of the question: "What is  actually produced because of an unconference?" And  the hard thing about  answering this is, all the productive, useful  stuff that is produced  isn't always tangible until a while after the  conference. Participants  at THATCamp have forumlated projects (and have  found collaborators)  during the event, including web-based resources,  research articles,  other conference sessions or events, and course  ideas. Some sessions  themselves either try to produce something during  their allotted time,  or make plans to continue working to produce  something after the event.  With that in mind, and to address the  skeptics' question, here are few  things actually produced from  THATCamp:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://chronicle.com/blog/ProfHacker/27/">ProfHacker</a> - The awesome blog about how academics can improve their workflow and talk about teaching and research techniques, now hosted at the Chronicle of Higher Education.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://zotero.umwblogs.org/zoterofest/">Zoterofest</a> - A one-day unconference/workshop at the University of Mary Washington, conceived by Jeff McClurken.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://digital-jumpstart.org">Digital  Jumpstart</a> - Unconference-like workshop run by Sharon Leon and Sheila Brennan, whose goals are to help digital humanities project get off the ground.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=dgzx6wms_257fzdg92g8">Ethical  Hacking in the Humanities</a> a group-edited syllabus on ethics in hacking for digital humanities, <a href="http://thatcamp.org/2010/hacking-ethics-for-edupunks/">a session proposed by John M. Jones</a> at THATCamp.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The broader thing to keep in mind is that sometimes things are actually produced during the sessions, sometimes afterwards, sometimes not at all. And in my experience, these results depend less on the unconference format itself, and depend more on the actual people leading and contributing to the session, and the unconference as a whole. With most academic    conferences,  you're expect to come with fully baked soufflés, and if    you don't (or  its a flop) then you face criticism. There isn't a lot of    space for  intellectual playfullness and experimentation in most    academic  conferences, but unconferences provide those kind of outlets;    In fact,  they thrive on them. And that to me is what conferences  should  be all about.</p>

<p>Many have loathed the rigidity,   formality, and expense of traditional academic conferences. In  contrast,  unconferences thrive on flexibility, collegiality, and thrift.  More to the  point, they rely heavily on the attendees  themselves—their  attitudes, motivations, and work ethics—for success or  failure. At  unconferences, it generally doesn't matter who says  something first;  What matters more is who says something thoughtful,  and what that thoughtful thing is.  Discovery happens through group cooperation. Insight  and knowledge are  not guarded for the next publication; They're shared  openly, with hopes  that others can contribute to ongoing conversations  that make our work  better.</p>

<p>And this really gets to the heart of the issue: Why do we attend conferences, and why do we contribute to them? Ideally, we give conference papers in hopes of sharing our research, getting recognition for such research, and getting critical feedback to take that research conference paper's  mere presence on the conference program grants it weight on CVs and  tenure reviews, even if only half a dozen people actually came to the  session to hear it read. What if instead we start fostering systems that reward you if your unconference session spawns half a dozen projects from attendees. The focus in this case is not on what you produce yourself, but what you help others produce.</p>

<p>Academic conferences as they are now are  increasingly expensive, poorly attended (not necessarily in terms of registrations, but it terms of people actually attending sessions), and rarely seem to  generate  the kind of innovative work needed to meet the challenges of education and scholarship today. If we want to start hacking the academy, lets start hacking this cornerstone of academic culture by incorporating unconferences.  We should start small, test some things out, makes changes when necessary. But we should start, if for no other reason than to  make the work we and  our colleagues do  better, and to make our experiences at conferences richer and more productive.</p>
