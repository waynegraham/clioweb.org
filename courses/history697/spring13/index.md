## Introduction

This course is designed as a intensive exploration of the adaptation of
history to a digital environment. As such it is a course in applied
history. While the central goal of the course is the development of an
original digital history project of professional quality, the course
will also examine issues in project management, information design,
front-end web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and aesthetic design.

## Requirements

### Reading

The texts in this class provide you with the background in several areas that might be unfamiliar to historians, and furnish you with a modest web design and development library for future work. A typical class will involve around an hour of discussing the readings for that particular week, an hour of lecture/presentation about a particular design/development topic, and an hour of practical exploration. Times and occurrences of these three will vary, but the structure will almost always be the same. The readings assigned for a particular class are often related to the applied portion of that class, so come prepared to not only discuss the reading material, but also to use the material in the class practicum.

The following books are required for this course. All are available in the campus bookstore except for Boulton and Chimero.

* Boulton, Mark. [A Practical Guide to Designing for the Web](http://fivesimplesteps.co.uk).
* Chimero, Frank. [The Shape of Design](http://shapeofdesign.com).
* Eismann, Katrin. Photoshop Restoration & Retouching. (3rd ed.)
* Garrett, Jesse James. The Elements of User Experience.
* McCloud, Scott. Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art.
* Meloni, Julie, Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours.
* Zeldman, Jeffrey. _Designing with Web Standards_. (3rd ed.)

In addition to assigned books and articles, I also ask that you pay attention to the “journals” of web design and development. Just as historians regularly read academic journals like the Journal of American History or The American Historical Review, professional web designers and developers also have publications that they regularly read and contribute to. You can download an OPML file on the course website to automatically add these RSS feeds to your newsreader.

* [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com)
* [Boxes and Arrows](http://boxesandarrows.com)
* [Contents Magazine](http://contentsmagazine.com/)
* [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/)

For inspiration, I recommend subscribing to a few design galleries and blogs:

* [CSS Beauty](cssbeauty.com)
* [CSS Mania](http://cssmania.com)
* [DesignSnips](designsnips.com)
* [Media Queries](http://mediaqueri.es)
* [PatternTap](http://patterntap.com)

### Software, Hardware, Hosting

Since this course uses computers and the Internet extensively, accesss
to, and familiarity with both, is essential. Although the university does not require the purchase of a computer, you to consider the investment if you do not have one.

As any experienced web developer can attest, you will need several
browsers to test your web work. I suggest you download the latest
version of the following browsers to test you work:

* Mac
  * Safari
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Opera
* Windows
  * Internet Explorer
  * Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Opera

You will need access to an image editing program. For those who will continue with new media as part of their history graduate work, Adobe Photoshop is the de facto standard, and is the software we’ll use in class. For those who see their new media work as occasional, Adobe Photoshop Elements is a powerful (and inexpensive) program that, except for some advanced color capabilities, has the same features as Photoshop.

A good text editor is also a must. Adobe Dreamweaver is a good option (and is the one installed in the lab), but there are many text editor applications. Remember: this class does not focus on a particular piece of software for web development; It focuses on how to write clean, semantic code. I can try my best to help troubleshoot software questions in and out of class, but you should rely primarily on the software’s documentation and company for support.

You will need a free account on [Github](http://github.com). Github is a
web service for creating and sharing source code repositories using Git.
 
An FTP program is also necessary to transfer files from your computer to your server. GMU ITU Support Center provides a free download of Secure Shell for Windows. Free options for Macintosh include CyberDuck and Fugu. I prefer an inexpensive Mac program called Transmit.

## Work

Work for the course will be weighted as follows:

* Personal portfolio page (10%)
* Design Exploration (10%)
* Web Typography Page (10%)
* Responsive Design Page (10%)
* Design Rationale (10%)
* Final Project (25%)
* Class Participation (25%)

### Personal Portfolio Page



### Design Exploration

Find something and critique its design in one page, and link to that
page from your personal portfolio. Explore the design choices (and assumptions!) that went
into the thing you choose. The thing could be anything: a web site, a
sign, a flyer, an electronic device, a writing implement, a water
bottle, a picture frame, a single letter.

### Web Typography Page

Create a single web page that demonstrates mastery in using type for
information and aest. The page should employ at least one web font, and 
include the following content elements:

* Page heading with title
* Navigation
* Content headings (h1–h6)
* Paragraphs
* An ordered and/or unordered list (nested at least two levels)
* A blockquote

### Responsive Design Page

Create a single web page that demonstrates mastery of responsive design.
The page should accommodate at least four different page widths. Some
suggestions:

* Smartphone (~300px)
* Tablet (~600px)
* Small desktop screen (~768px)
* Large desktop screen (~960px)

### Mood Board

Create a mood board that will inform the design direction for your final
project. The format of this is open, but a few suggested approaches:

* Single image composed in Photoshop
* Board on Pinterest
* Gallery in Flickr or some other image service

The goal of this is to colle
### Design Rationale

For this assignment, create a 2–4 page document detailing the design
rationale for your final project. It should include:

1. A paragraph summarizing the overall design direction for your
   project.
2. a logo/logotype for your project that explains the fonts used and design message
2. a color palette with color values for hex and RGB.
3. 2-3 color mockups of pages on your site.

Upload the Design Rationale document as a PDF to your Github site, and link to it in a blog post that introduces the document and details your process for completing it.

Final Project (Presentations on 05/04; Final due 05/11)
All of the prior assignments contribute to the final project: the creation of a modest, reasonably sophisticated history web site. First, the content should be solid and engaging. Second, the site should be clear in its purpose and potential audience, and adhere to the Scope and Strategy, and information architecture set out at the beginning of the semester. Third, the site should demonstrate standards-based, accessible design. In other words, the site should have passed validation tests for XHTML and CSS. Fourth, the site’s design should also reflect knowledge of typography, layout, color, and graphic design, as reflected in the Design Rationale and HTML/CSS mockups.

## Policies

### Communicating

Feel free to contact me through any of these methods:

* AIM: jboggs22
* Google Talk: jeremy@clioweb.org
* Email: jboggs@masonlive.gmu.edu (use “Hist 697: Your Subject” in your email subject line.)
* Phone: 703-244-1139 (cell)
* Twitter: clioweb

### Students with Disabilities

If you are a student with a disability and you need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at (703) 993-2474. All academic accommodations must be arranged through that office.

Additionally, if during the semester you contract an illness, or are injured in some way that prevents you from completing assignments regularly and on-time, you will also need to contact the DRC.

### Late Assignments

In a class where collaboration and peer feedback are frequent, punctuality is absolutely necessary. Assignments not ready for presentation cannot benefit from class feedback; late blog posts result in fewer comments and less exchange among participants. Therefore, assignments are due on the date indicated on the syllabus; blog posts are due at noon the day before the due date in order to give class members a chance to comment. Late assignments and blog posts will be accepted up to a week after the due date; One letter grade, however, be deducted. After the grace period, late submissions will receive an “F” except in cases of documented and university sanctioned reasons.

A Word of Warning: I will not accept technology-related excuses for late or incomplete assignments. Computers, like many other things built by human beings, are imperfect. A computer or other technology-related problem can (and probably will) occur, so you should take steps to minimize these problems. Back up your work obsessively. Complete your assignments as early as possible. If your computer shorts out, your hard drive crashes, or the Internet goes down, make sure you have access to other computer resources. There are several computer labs for students on campus, which are free to use.

### Grades

Grades for the course are assigned in the following manner:

* A – Outstanding work, complete mastery of the material presented, combined with some originality.
* B – A solid command of the material with some minor gaps or mistakes.
* C – Some knowledge of the material; Infrequent but significant confusions and errors present.
* D – An incomplete, minimal knowldge of the material; Frequent and/or
major confusions and errors.
* F – A complete lack of understanding of the course material.
* I – There are no incompletes given in this course except in cases of bona fide and documented instances in accordance with the regulations of the university.
* P – For a “pass” a “C” average is required.

If you receive a grade with which you do not agree, feel free to discuss it with me by appointment. I am open to changing a grade if given sufficient reason, but be very prepared to make your case.
