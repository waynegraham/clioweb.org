					<p>This may be one of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg">funniest / coolest</a> guys to ever live. His depictions of classic to modern dance styles makes you chuckle to yourself a little bit. If any of you have ever done any of these dances, you know that little chuckle I&#8217;m talking about. This clip emphasizes not only the different styles of dance, but also the music and attitude that went with the time. <strong>If history is bound to repeat itself, which I belive it does, we will see some of these moves come back in a crazy RAGE!</strong></p>
<p>Just think about it. When we were kids back in the late 80&#8217;s break dancing was at an all time record high. It was what everyone did. Then it kind of dyed off and Rock was the king of dance with crazy mosh pits and people flailing around like crazy. Now days its hip hop, with its bump and grind, and hip hop dance moves, but you still see some resemblance from some of the dance steps. Crip Walking looks an awful lot like a break dancers top rock, just with a little bit more style and some modern day enhancements. Hip Hop dances are similar to moves you would have only done at the disco, while rockin&#8217; your favorite pair of bell bottoms, just more speed and a little bit more pep to your step. Even moves like the chicken dance are still in use today at things like weddings. I know I&#8217;ve flapped the wings recently.<br />
It&#8217;s strange to think that in the short time that we have experienced in this world, how much has changed and evolved. I mean back in the day New Kids on the Block Jeans were the coolest thing along with the Zack Morris haircut. If you had those two super attributes of the time, man you were the coolest cat on the block. I can&#8217;t wait for the return of break dancing, I&#8217;ve even got an old school pair of white adidas for when the day comes.</p>

					<p>While you may believe that with all of our high powered technology and scientific advancements, we will soon be in the age of the jetsons, that view may be completely wrong. According to Mayan Prophecies, the world is scheduled to end on December 21, 2012. Yes the Mayans were people who inhabited this planet a long long time ago back in 250 A.D., and technology then is not what it is now, but why is it that the Mayan calendar is still considered to be more accurate than the one that we use today. <strong>All of the Mayan doomsday prophecies to date have been correct and have actually occured, if we don&#8217;t start to take action now in finding a resolution, life as we know it may end.</strong></p>
<p>Although the Mayan civilizations communicated through hieroglyph drawings, they were actually a very scientifically advanced civilization. They possessed great knowledge within the realms of astrology, mathematics, timing, and calendars. They were even so precise that they had two calendars, one that was ritualistic and used for astral predictions and religious celebratrions. The other was a solar calendar. Both calendars were based upon a principle that a year had more than the 365 days, unlike the Gregorian Calendar in which we rely on to date. Through the use of these calendars Mayans were able to predict natural occurances such as Seasons and even eclipses. Something that in that day and age would seem almost impossible.</p>
<p>The Mayans figured through use of astrology and their two calendars that the earths rotation around the galaxy would take is 25,625 years to realign in the same manner. This period was then divided in to 5 cycles of 5,125 years. It was speculated that every 5,125 year cycle the earth would realign with the &#8216;central&#8217; galaxy theory, effectively changing the Sun&#8217;s magnetic fields resulting in catastrophic evens on earth. According to Mayan predictions we are currently in between the 5th and 6th cycles. More information about the prophecies and signs can be found <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/mjfinley/katun.html">here.</a></p>
<p>Overall the Mayans were way ahead of their time. The excess knowledge that they possesed is hard to comprehend without the use of modern day technology. It is debatable whether or not the world will actually end at the end of the Mayan calendar, or if we will just be transcended in to a new form of life. I guess we will just have to wait and see.</p>

				<small>Tuesday, May 8th, 2007</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>As super paranoid, anti-(current) government, believer of conspiracy theories, I have exhausted the internet of conspiracy videos. After the horrific attacks upon our country on 9/11 I began to speculate more and more whether or not our own people were responsible for the tragedies. I watched hours upon hours of film, and read pages among pages of research on the topics at hand that could possibly shine some light on what really happened. It was not until I stumbled upon a video entitled <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003">&#8220;9-11 Mysteries&#8221;,</a>  that everything all became so horrifically apparent. <strong>While the government may still deny any involvement in the attacks on September 11th, this video makes it almost undeniable that there is some sort of cover up going on.</strong></p>
<p>The video, produced by a man name Brad, a conservative republican, is possibly the most scientifically analyzed approach at the topic. For Brad, the journey to conspiracy began actually when he viewed another documentary on the subject. &#8220;Painful Truths of 9-11&#8243; by Eric Huffschmidt was what set him out on his quest. Brad was determined to prove the documentary wrong, and along the way of his research he realized that it was actually the official report released by the government that was shrouded in lies and not the documentary. While the video does claim that the falling of the twin towers was not caused by the explosions of the planes that crashed in to the building, it does not point any fingers at anyone. Rather it leaves the opinion part up to the viewer to decide.</p>
<p>Even though the video is and hour and forty five minutes long, it keeps you captivated by the continual presentation scientific supported claims. The official FEMA and PBS documentaries are explained and then challenged, but again, no fingers are pointed to who did what, the video just shows you that what we are being told is not the truth and something is being covered up. The video uses a barrage of science and understanding to essentially show you the whole picture of what happened. Facts like the melting point of steel, the enormous core of the towers that just disappears, and comparisons of other steel structure that burned for 24 hours and were still standing were just some of the things that gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach about what was going on. More over, the big business men involved in what happened, and their actions pre and post 9-11 were completely unreal. It is almost as if they have sold their souls to the devil.</p>
<p>I think that anyone that cares about the future of our country, anyone that may have lost friends or family because of horrible tragedies like this, anyone who is even alive should watch this video. It may be the one thing that changes your mind about how you perceive the men and women that supposedly represent your country. America seems to be getting pulled out of underneath our own feet, and soon enough we will all realize, but will it be too late?</p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Beer. It&#8217;s so good when it hits your lips. This magical substance was first stumbled upon by accident in the 10,000 BC era by a group of nomads. They discovered that when the grains that were soaked by the rain, were left alone for a while, it would produce a drink that seemed to have mystical properties. This specific example was what caused the nomads to finally domesticate and stay in one place, so that they would have a steady supply of raw material for their beers. Not only did the beer possess mystical qualities, but it also served for an evolution point of the human race. Until about the eighty and ninth century AD, beer remained pretty standard and followed its original recipie. It was then in Central Europe that Hops began to make a mark on the beer industry. <strong>Although beer did not explode in the United States until about the mid nineteenth century, the brewing, quality, and selection of beer have since went on a rampant evolution. </strong></p>
<p>In the 1620&#8217;s, Pilgrims on the Mayflower land at Plymouth rock, it is said that the choice to land at Plymouth Rock could have reinforced by the shortage of supplies, especially beer. The next evolution of beer came through in the 1820&#8217;s through the form of trying to get beer to keep longer. English brewers began to brew beers with increasing amounts of hops, so that they could withstand the long journeys without going bad. By increasing the amount of Hops in the beer they effictively alterd the recipie and were left with what we refer to today as an India Pale Ale. It is possible that the name was taken because these brews were made to carry on the journeys that were made to Britan&#8217;s colonies in Asia.</p>
<p>The year 1819 came rolling in, thanks to Thomas Holloway came the new invention of the steam engine, the first of its kinda to be used in American Beer Production. 1829 marked the year that David G. Yuengling opened what today is America&#8217;s oldest operating brewerey in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In 1844 another famous brewery was started by Jacob Best in Milwaukee, this would later transform in to the Pabst Brewing Company, makers of that wonderful can of PBR. In 1852, George Schneider laid the ground work for what would become the Anheuser-Busch Brewing company. By the early 1900s there were over 2,000 breweries in operation in the United States. They continue to grow and produce more and more beer, but prohibition begins to be adoped and enforced.</p>
<p>It was at this point around 1910 that breweries begin to decline to around 1500. by 1912, Nine states voted to be Dry, by 1916 23 states were dry. Eventually by 1919, with that passing of the 18th Amendment, National Prohibition put a dent in to the beercan. Distilleries were closed by acts of the Food Control Law, and breweries began producing &#8216;near beers&#8217;. It was not until about 1933 that prohibition was lifted and brewers started up again with operation. In the years from 1940-1951, the tax on barrels of beer rises from $5.00 all the way up to $9.00. This additional burden on the breweries causes many to close down, resulting in around 400 breweries being in operation. 10 more years go by and only 230 breweries remain, but the introduction of the aluminum can by Coors brewing of Golden, Colorado, and the ring pull can spark new hope for the beer companies. By 1969 canned beer began to outsell bottled beer for the first time.</p>
<p>In 1982, we saw the first Brewerey / Pub. From the first time since prohibition, a brewery was allowed to open to no only sell beer, but also sell food out of the same venue. This is what we know as bars today. Anywhere you go, that serves beer of course, owes thanks to Bert Grant&#8217;s Yakima Brewing and Malting  Company. in the following years, brewing companies continue to decrease in number, but those that survived were expanding operations. by 1984 the top 6 brewing companies were controlling 92% of the beer production for the US.</p>
<p>In the following 20 years many advancements would break through in the beer game. From fridge packs to plastic can liners, beer brewers were dishing it all out. Today we have all sorts of past times connected through beer, Baseball games, drinking games, barbecueing, you name it, beer is probably there. Beer is sold everywhere, even at small resturant style pizza shops.<br />
While beer assisted in the transition from nomadic hunter gather to a more domesticated form, these days it seems to do the complete opposite. People go from being domesticated, normal human beings to complete waste cases that have no bodily control nor brain functions. I guess you cant really expect less and according to a recent Brewers Association 2007 Beer Style Guideline, it was found that there are offically 125 different styles of ales and lagers produced around the world! With that many choices to choose from, you know someone is out there opening a beer as your finish reading this.</p>

					<p>On September 11, 2001, everyone was continuing their every day life when something teriible happened to our country. An airplane hit one of the twin towers without any warning. the look on the people&#8217;s face was shocked and scared. No one knew what exactly was goin gon. Later on maybe an hour has passed; another plane had hit the other twin tower. With these two buildings all of a sudden gettin ghit by airplanes, something was not right. The investigation of the two airplanes striking both the two twin towers needed to find out the truth behind it.</p>
<p>With two airplanes that all of a sudden hit two of the twon towers wasn&#8217;t normal at all. As the day went on, investigation started to began tryin gto fin dout the reason behind this terrible problem. As the days went on, the police investigator started to suspect that it was a terrorist attack. The leader behind this terrible act was from Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network. Once Bush found out about this news, he declared &#8221; war on terror&#8221;.</p>
<p>Osama bin Laden has been a prime suspect against the United States. Since 1998, Osama bin Laden has been linked to several attacks including the embassy bombings in De res Salaam, Nairobi, Kenya, and Tanzania. According the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Osama bin Laden is wanted for the top ten fugitives. Although for all o fhis involvements, the September 11 attacks is far worst then all of his involvements combined together. Although Osama bin Laden has not been idicted for the September 11 attacks, he has taken responsibility for those attacks.</p>
<p>As a citizen in the United States, we must be aware for all the issues that is going around. People like Osama bin Laden can be everywhere withought knowing it. Osama bin Laden as an  individual has taken so many innocent lives. The fact that Osama bin Laden has taken responsibility for these terrible accidents will never be forgotten. Osama bin Laden will always be remember as we gon on with out lives and for many future generations to come.</p>

					<p>As a kid growing up, the only inkling I have of any religious activity was when the family got together for holiday lunches and dinners and said grace before we ate. I never went to church, temple, synagouge or any places of worship really, but the times that I did, I was rather uncomfortable in the situation. Earlier on I believed that there was a god, and that whoever or wherever he was, he was looking out for me. As I began to get older and start to discover what religions held what characteristics, it seemed more to me that everyone of them had their own opinions and ideals, and if you didn&#8217;t agree with it you were going to hell. That was just a little bit absurd to me so I began to stray away from the thoughts of God. I began to debate if Religion was something created by man, to instill an undeniable fear in those that believed in it, in turn creating a way of control over a faction of people. It wasn&#8217;t for a while that I finally came to graps with how I actually feel. I believe that there is an actual God out there, I do not believe in Heaven and Hell, but rebirth of the soul. <strong>Religion is something that is a personal thought, something that if you believe in hard enough and you practice what you preach, then you are okay and you aren&#8217;t going to go to hell.</strong><br />
The stories of each religion are presented in a plethora of different ways, with different gods, different saviors, different bibles, and different beliefs, but it seems that all are working towards a unified goal, usually one of salvation or enlightenment. With so many options, how would one that had no previous religious knowledge know which to believe and which would actually lead them to their ultimate goal? How do we even know that what we are preaching is truly going to lead us to salvation, and that it wasn&#8217;t all just made up by some guy reading a special stone in his special decoder HAT!?</p>
<p>A real life example was recently by the Clock Tower of the JC. There is a gentleman that is constantly there that preaches his faith, not sure which one, but he sits there screaming off passages out of his bible. Who is he to say what he believes in is the correct faith. He even directed a statement towards me asking me if I had &#8220;accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior.&#8221; When I told him that I believe that there is a god out there that looks over all of us, he exclaimed that I was going to hell. My automatic recriprocation to his thought was, &#8220;Is anyone that doesn&#8217;t agree with you and your version of the bible, essientially going to hell?&#8221; His answer was a Stern &#8220;Yes, but I can still save myself, by accepting Jesus Christ in to my life and calling him my savior. It was at this point that I did not was to start a holy war and walked away.</p>
<p>I actually ended up going home and as much as I didn&#8217;t want to think about it, I kept replaying the situation in my head, over and over again. It was a few days later, that I finally came up with a paradox to his statement so to speak. If I recall correctly, A person who claims to be Aethist, is a person that does not believe in God, heaven, hell, or any of the usual religious proceedings. They believe that once a person dies, his body and flesh is recycle in to the earth, just like any other living thing. So technically here he would be wrong as of so far because while he is taught that Jesus Christ is his savior and Jesus will save anyone that belives in him. Well if Aethists dont believe in heaven or hell, then even if they dont accept Jesus Christ as their savior, where exactly is it that they go when they die? Can&#8217;t be heaven or hell because those two technically don&#8217;t exist in that persons mind or faith.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m ultimately trying to get at here is not debunking religion. I just believe that Religion has taken a stray road from what it may have originally been. Now a days its all about spreading your faith to those that do not know it, in order to convert them to your way of thinking. I&#8217;ve heard of stuff like that before, but it was rather difficult to understand because it was in GERMAN! It seems that Churches are now one of the biggest &#8216;business&#8217; schemes on the planet. Have you ever seen how lavish some of the churches that are being constructed these days are? I&#8217;m sure that god listens to the poor just as much as he does the rich, so what is the use of having golden angel fountains that spit water in to a pool? Does that allow the practitioners of that lavish church more liberties than those of less fortunate churches? If you have a strong belief if your own faith, than it shouldn&#8217;t matter if everyone else around you believes in it too. If you can&#8217;t see that than you might not be as faithful as you think.</p>
<p>This post was not meant to offend anyone or make fun of any religions, yet it is a touchy topic, so feel free to go rampant with comments. While I do not necessairly have a designated faith, I was raised under a Buddihst ideal by my father and mother. Personally, I am not a practicing buddhist, nor do I adhere to all of the paths to enlightenment that are set forth, yet. I do however try to instill some of the views and teachings in my everyday life. I believe in the teachings of reincarnation of the soul in multiple forms, let it be person, animal or and living species and that every living object has a soul. I don&#8217;t believe in killing anything unless it is for survival, let it be for food or protection. You never know if that hamburger you are eating was your uncle who may have passes away years before. Lastly,  Karma, it plays a huge role in our lives and screams that old saying &#8220;Do unto others, as you would like done unto you.&#8221;</p>

Well if Aethists dont believe in heaven or hell, then even if they dont accept Jesus Christ as their savior, where exactly is it that they go when they die? Can&#8217;t be heaven or hell because those two technically don&#8217;t exist in that persons mind or faith.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m ultimately trying to get at here is not debunking religion. I just believe that Religion has taken a stray road from what it may have originally been. Now a days its all about spreading your faith to those that do not know it, in order to convert them to your way of thinking. I&#8217;ve heard of stuff like that before, but it was rather difficult to understand because it was in GERMAN! It seems that Churches are now one of the biggest &#8216;business&#8217; schemes on the planet. Have you ever seen how lavish some of the churches that are being constructed these days are? I&#8217;m sure that god listens to the poor just as much as he does the rich, so what is the use of having golden angel fountains that spit water in to a pool? Does that allow the practitioners of that lavish church more liberties than those of less fortunate churches? If you have a strong belief if your own faith, than it shouldn&#8217;t matter if everyone else around you believes in it too. If you can&#8217;t see that than you might not be as faithful as you think.</p>
<p>This post was not meant to offend anyone or make fun of any religions, yet it is a touchy topic, so feel free to go rampant with comments. While I do not necessairly have a designated faith, I was raised under a Buddihst ideal by my father and mother. Personally, I am not a practicing buddhist, nor do I adhere to all of the paths to enlightenment that are set forth, yet. I do however try to instill some of the views and teachings in my everyday life. I believe in the teachings of reincarnation of the soul in multiple forms, let it be person, animal or and living species and that every living object has a soul. I don&#8217;t believe in killing anything unless it is for survival, let it be for food or protection. You never know if that hamburger you are eating was your uncle who may have passes away years before. Lastly,  Karma, it plays a huge role in our lives and screams that old saying &#8220;Do unto others, as you would like done unto you.&#8221;</p>

					<p>During the 1950’s and 60’s, it was a time where the African-Americans made a mark in history for doing what they believe in which is telling everyone that they are the same as every human being out there. Their encouragement will teach the future that they should be equally treated like the rest of the human population. African-Americans were segregated in almost every aspect including public transportation, public restrooms, and public water fountains. Bus and train transportation did not provide separated vehicles for each race but they did divide the sections of the bus and train according to your race. <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_parks">Rosa</a></strong><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_parks"> Parks</a> refused to give up her seat to a white man and till this day; no one will be where they are right now if it wasn’t for Rosa Parks.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong> <strong>            </strong>Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man sparked a lot controversy. So severe and outrageous, she was arrested and her case was taken to the court where she was found guilty. With the African-Americans on her side, they boycotted and rallied in the rain which took 382 days. While this was going on, African-American homes and churches were burn. So outrageous, the boycott gained a lot of support around the community and the case of Browder vs. Gayle was file which ended segregation on public buses.         </p>
<p>            What Rosa Parks did was very courageous. Being an African-American during that time was very difficult. Everything that you did was not allowed. It seemed as if someone was watching you trying to catch every move that you did. Rosa Parks believed in herself and didn’t want to be treated differently. Rosa Parks have made a difference in today’s society which allows anyone to do whatever they want to do. With so much freedom, we wouldn’t be doing what we want if it wasn’t for Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks is a wonderful influence on everyone out there that cannot believe in themselves. What Rosa Parks did has earned her recognition around the country. Being brave as it is, it teaches us to stand up for yourself and don’t let the law stop you from doing something that you believe is right.</p>

					<p>Through out high school I have been taught that the second world war was great for our economy. Then I get to college and my &#8220;Adam Smith view, Liberal,&#8221; says that the war was not good for our economy, here are the reasons why, someone please help me understand, now I&#8217;m torn between my thoughts of the war on the economy. In high school I was taught that the war was good because there was a decline in the unemployment rates. However, my professor told us that the times during the war were not standard times, and that 18% of the jobs created were by the drafting of military members. Also he said that you cannot count women working during the war because they would not have chose to do so. Over all he said that this claim is false because the employment created was not promoting well being of the people so it doesn&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>In high school I was also taught that there was a great increase in the measure of real gnp, but he disarms this idea with saying that the production of war materials such as tanks and guns do should not count in the GNP, only &#8216;butter,&#8217; the things that would be produced in normal peace times. So here are some things that my professor has tried to discredit, Im lost for what the right answer is, maybe its a matter of perception.</p>

					<p>So i was reading this <a title="article" href="http://www.myfoxdc.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=2381662&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.1.1">article</a> and became very upset and thought I would blog about it.  Now Bush is saying that Iran is supplying all of these weapons to Iraq. I have been calling this for along time. Ever since Bush decieded to talk about the &#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221; (which consists of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea), I have been awaiting the day he brings the next country into the war plans. He has been looking for different ways to anger the people into wanting to attack Iran and now he finally came up with one. Who cares that it is not proven that Iran&#8217;s government is the one providing these weapons?&#8221;I&#8217;m going to do something about it,&#8221; Bush pledged, displaying apparent irritation at being repeatedly asked about mixed administration signals on who was behind the weaponry.</p>
<p>This quote angers me the most. Who cares if the American people want to get involved? No its up to Bush, and Bush alone to decide that. I can only say that I am thankful that the executive branch and the legislative branch are now majority two different political parties. I am also thankful that he is nearing the end of his regime, it is time to get a sane person back in the White House before our foreign relations are damaged beyond repair.</p>
