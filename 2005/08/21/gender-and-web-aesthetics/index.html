    <h1>Gender and Web Aesthetics</h1>

  </header>

  <div class="content">

    <p><a href="http://airbagindustries.com">Airbag Industries</a> recently posted about a <a href="http://www.glam.ac.uk/news/releases/003056.php">University of Glamorgan presss release announcing the results of a study on how gender influences web aesthetic preferences</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"We started off by looking at the personal websites created by 60 university students, 30 male and 30 female, to discover whether there were any major design differences. We looked at factors such as language, visuals, and navigation - the differences were immediately apparent," explained Gloria Moss. "We compared the sites on 23 factors and differences emerged on just over half of these. This is a massive number".</p></blockquote>

<p>Personal websites of university students differ greatly in scope and content than business or educational websites. I'm not sure if a study of how students reacting to other student-designed websites really reveals anything. But I do think this is an important study, especially for a medium in which "74%" of websites "were produced by a man or a predominantly male team while just 7% were designed by a female or female team." The press release meanders between arguments for more female web designers (which there absolutely should be) and more feminine design. And, from the way I read the release, the feminine design part is on the border between smart and sexist. Smart in that women make up a large (if not majority) of web visitors and contributors, so it's good to appeal to them. Sexist, in that it's almost like saying, "Yeah, lets put some light colors and curves in for the ladies." See the next quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>Where visuals are concerned, males favour the use of straight lines (as opposed to rounded forms), few colours in the typeface and background, and formal typography. As for language, they favour the use of formal or expert language with few abbreviations and are more likely to promote themselves and their abilities heavily.</p></blockquote>

<p>But is saying that men prefer "formal or expert language with few abbreviations" mean that women don't? It will be helpful when/if we get to read the actual study instead of the press release, but to me it seems more hurtful than helpful.The press release doesn't actually say what women preferred; most commentary on the release so far have assumed that women like the opposite of the things in the quote. And this study apparently doesn't take into consideration what kind of information the site tries to convey. This study might be useful; I'm really not sure yet.</p>

<p>What should we really do with this information? Should we make separate, changeable stylesheets for male and female visitors? Should we think more about designing for a broader audience? Or should we design based on the content I'm asking this not only as a web designer but also as an historian who wants web-based history to appeal to a variety of vistiors. How much does gender identity affect your perception of a history website? Is <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/index.html">Women and World History</a> a more "feminine" site, and is <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/history120/">History 120</a> a more "masculine" site? (I designed History 120, and <a href="http://www.archiva.net">Paula Petrik</a> designed Women and World History.) Does subject matter play a role in how web-based history is presented?</p>

<p>Update: <a href="http://successfulacademic.typepad.com/successful_academic_tips/2005/08/mars_and_venus_.html">Academic Coach</a> noted the study last Monday. Natalie at Phobiblion featured the Coach's post on her <a href="http://philobiblion.blogspot.com/2005/08/friday-femmes-fatales-no-19.html">Friday Femme Fatales No. 19</a>.</p>
