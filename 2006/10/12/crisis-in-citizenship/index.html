    <h1>Crisis in Citizenship?</h1>

  </header>

  <div class="content">

    <p>Eugene Hickok believes that tax-payer dollars shouldn't be used to "underwrite courses in such things as the history of comic book art." Hickok's recent op-ed piece in the <em>New York Times</em>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/11/opinion/11hickok.html">"No Undergrad Left Behind,"</a> (registration free, but required) argues for more transparency and accountability on the part of colleges and universities. A member of the National Civics Literacy Board at the <a href="http://www.isi.org/">Intercollegiate Studies Institute</a> (ISI), Hickok sees college education falling into a dismal abyss that only the the philosophies of the No Child Left Behind program can save. Hickok references a report based on standardized test results, <a href="http://www.americancivicliteracy.org/index.html">"The Coming Crisis in Citizenship,"</a> created by ISI. The test quizzed "more than 14,000 randomly selected college freshmen and seniors at 50 colleges and universities across the country." The results: "college seniors failed the civic literacy assessment with an average score of 53.2 percent."</p>

<h3>You Don't Need College to Pass This Test</h3>

<p>The test involved 60 multiple-choice questions covering a (not-so-broad) variety of topics, listed in the <a href="http://www.americancivicliteracy.org/report/additional_tables.html#table9">Test Question Themes chart</a> on the ISI site. ("Because the survey is ongoing, the full survey instrument is unavailable for distribution.") I'd <strong>love</strong> to see what's on this quiz, but we'll have to wait until they release it. In the meantime, perhaps the <a href="http://www.americancivicliteracy.org/resources/quiz.aspx">sample quiz</a> will suffice.</p>

<p>Like it or not, you don't actually <em>need</em> to go to college or university to learn the basic facts to pass this test. Anyone with $30.00 (give or take) and the motivation to do so can buy a modest college history or government textbook, study it for a few weeks, and pass this test. Actually, you don't need $30.00; Just go to your local library, sign up for some computer time, and read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> articles (which, despite criticism to the contrary, easily have information accurate enough to pass the ISI test, let alone the sample quiz). You could consult <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/tools/h-bot/">H-Bot</a> to answer a few questions. For example, the <a href="http://www.americancivicliteracy.org/resources/quiz.aspx">sample quiz</a> on the ISI site asks: "During which period was the American Constitution amended to guarantee women the right to vote?" <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu/tools/h-bot/?q=when+did+the+constitution+give+women+the+right+to+vote%3F&amp;use=G">CHNM's H-Bot can answer this question: C. 1900-1925 (H-Bot says 1920, specifically).</a>1 If H-Bot can correctly answer 75-80% of the quiz's questions, does that make H-Bot an "informed and engaged" citizen?</p>

<h3>What is Engaged Citizenship?</h3>

<p>The problem with Mr. Hickok's editorial and with similar opinions is they have an unfounded belief that knowledge of basic historical facts makes for a good, engaged citizen. Quite the opposite; Knowing facts simply to pass a standardized test not only fails to help students "understand their nation's history and founding principles," it fails to help them become "informed and engaged citizens."</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Historical-Thinking-Other-Unnatural-Acts/dp/1566398568/sr=8-1/qid=1160661738/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9796278-5091357?ie=UTF8">As Sam Weinberg has argued</a>, historical <em>thinking</em> is what matters, not historical memorization. Do I think it is important that students understand historical facts? Absolutely. I do not, however, expect them to memorize facts; that's what textbooks and other resources are for. I think multiple-choice, fact-only tests are not only boring, they're also insulting and demeaning, and do nothing to "engage" students. I want students to be able to understand and challenge <em>why</em> we focus on certain facts and not others, and <em>how</em> we use those facts in debate and discussion. The ISI test won't teach students to question <em>why</em> teachers discuss the Monroe Doctrine, for example, and question why they <em>don't</em> discuss slavery in the United States. (Interestingly, there's nothing in the themes list about slavery in the United States.) If we teach only to help students pass this test, or to simply memorize facts, we are failing our students. Plain. And. Simple.</p>

<p>Informed and engaged citizenship does not involve the ability to remember facts. Instead, it involves the ability to think about which facts are important (and which are not), how others use facts to shape arguments, and why those facts and those arguments are important as opposed to others. This ability stretches well beyond the study of history. I don't simply want students to remember that, in 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in the United States (or, more accurately, prohibited disenfranchisement based on sex). I want them to think about <em>why</em> we needed an amendment in the first place for women to be able to vote, and <em>why</em> it took so long after the creation of the Constitution to create and pass such an amendment. That's the kind of questioning and critical thinking that makes for a informed and engaged citizen. And that's the kind of questioning and critical thinking I hope college students learn in history and government classrooms. Put simply, I want my students to ask <em>why</em> with anything they encounter, then go forth unafraid to seek out the answer.</p>

<p>And for the record, I think it would be <strong>awesome</strong> to take a course on the history of comic book art, and maybe even teach one someday.</p>
